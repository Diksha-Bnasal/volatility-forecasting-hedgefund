**Resume Summary:** Developed a risk-adjusted trading strategy using volatility forecasting (GARCH models) and momentum factors, implementing a reproducible pipeline with Python and R.

# 📊 Smart Volatility Forecasting & Momentum Strategy

**Volatility forecasting and risk-adjusted strategy modeling using GARCH and momentum factors**

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **quantitative research pipeline** for building a **risk-adjusted trading strategy** using **volatility forecasting (GARCH models)** and **momentum factors**. It is designed to mirror real-world hedge fund research, with a focus on:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Historical daily stock prices for liquid US equities.
- **Volatility Modeling:** GARCH-family models (GARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH) to forecast future volatility.
- **Factor Construction:** Momentum signals calculated from historical returns.
- **Risk-Adjusted Strategy:** Dynamic position sizing using predicted volatility and momentum filters.
- **Backtesting & Evaluation:** Performance assessed with Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, turnover, and robustness tests.

---

## Key Features
- Reproducible, modular workflow for research and backtesting
- Out-of-sample validation and robustness across market regimes
- Clear visualization of returns, risk, and strategy signals
- Designed to be scalable and re-usable for additional assets or timeframes

---

## Purpose
This project showcases the **full research cycle used in hedge funds** — hypothesis formulation, data processing, statistical modeling, strategy construction, and performance evaluation — all implemented in **Python and R**.
